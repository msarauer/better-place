Tell a story

- 2 dudes trying to find an opportunity to volunteer. A web developer is looking for some last minute help from a web developer to finish up their final project for a bootcamp since the instructors thought it would be a good idea to deprioritize them in the queue right before demo day...

Intro- Introduce ourselves, and explain briefly why we joined bootcamp.

Step One- Login. (Already have account setup for easy login.)
Mitch Logs in

Step Two- Mitch creates need

Step Three- Cecil and Logan browse needs showcasing all filters and sorters as well as map
(Choose random category then mess with the filters and sorts eventually landing on education. Then go to map to specifically to show distance filter)
(Choose the closest one)
(They find an education opp that helps someone study for the bootcamp final or something similar, realize this is a good choice because we are developers and could definitely help)

Step Four- Something is not clear so Cecil and Logan use chat to clarify
("We seen your opportunity, and were wondering if it was okay if my friend joined as well, we are both developers.)

Step Five-

Outro-

hardships- We had some issues with type errors (saw the benefit that adding typescript could have)
solutions to those hardships,
what we would like to add to our app, (gifs and emojis to chat)

Mitch Script -------------
Hey guys, I'm Mitch. I have a background in Civil Engineering and project management before finally deciding to make the switch and join this bootcamp. I had such a blast during bootcamp and this project, and that re-affirmed my decision to make this switch. I'm so happy to be here.

Logan Script --------------
Hey everybody, I'm Logan, I can't believe bootcamp is coming to an end, this has been an amazing experience. Working with Mitch and Cecil these last two weeks has been fantastic, I really couldn't have asked for better teammates. I really hope you enjoy our app, it was hard work and we are all very proud of the result.
(Already logged in and ready to go)

Cecils Script -------------
Hey everyone! My name is Cecil. Im really excited to show you what we have done today. The struggles we faced together as a team, I feel strengthened our core abilities as developers. Working side by side constantly with these two brilliant coders was a total blast. Everyone stayed super positive in the face of the issues we had to overcome so it actually made these last two weeks the most fun this entire bootcamp. I really hope you enjoy what we have done!

Act 1--------

Mitch - So let me tell you a story...
One day I was sitting at home struggling with my final project for a web development bootcamp with no help in sight because the mentor queue was weirdly deprioritized to people just finishing their project. Suddenly I remembered that I already had an account created for an amazing site called better place, which helps connect people with needs to local people looking to help others! So... I log in to the site and immediately create my opportunity to find help from a local web developer...

(Mitch Logins and posts a new Opportunity)

ACT II --------

    (fade in to Cecil and Logan)

Logan - Hey Im Logan, I'm a local web developer! My friend cecil and I are looking to make the world a better place by helping others locally. Hey Cecil, how do you think we can help others?

Cecil - Well we have been sitting in front of a computer for the past 12 weeks, So hopefully we can help someone outside!

        * Make sure to hover and check other categories *
    (Go through the categories hovering on a couple before choosing one)

Logan - Oh check out these categories, lets try... physical since you wanted to find something outside

    (Choose one NOT education)

    (Browse a few categories and trying a few filters and sorts)

    (Type 'outdoors' search word)

Logan - Oh here is one, her reviews are really good too, lets do it, oh wait, these results are too far away"

Cecil - "I dont really want to go to far so maybe lets clear these filters and check out the map view"

    (Filter by distance to see ones that are closest)

Logan - Heres one, Oh and check it out its a web development issue.

Cecil - Thats great we just finished a bootcamp so hopefully we can help!

Logan - Lets see what tech stack he needs help with.`  
 (Open chat from specific opportunity)
(Message: '?')

Logan- Here are some older volunteer things I did.
(Make sure to click other chat contact)

Cecil - Oh neato!!

Logan - While we wait check out the profile I made.

        (Check the profile and goes through it all)

        (Message comes in from Mitch)

Logan - Oh gee willikers batman looks like we have a new message

Cecil - Blamo lets check it out.

        (Go back to chat box to and respond)

ACT III ----

Cecil - Ok thats our app! Thanks you so much for watching! In this application we used the PERN stack. We used React and material ui for the front end. Node.js AND express for the back and For the database we used postgresQL. We also used Google map AND geocoding APIs.

Logan - Challenges we encountered were:
We had to fix a few bugs due to typing issues, and we all realized the advantages that using typescript would bring.
We used Socket.io for the chat was a challenge because it was something fresh we all needed to learn. We overcame this and many other struggles with tons of paired programming and great teamwork.

Mitch - Wrap-up- So please join us for tasty snacks and beverages in our breakout room (bring your own of course) after the presentations and we'd be happy to answer any questions you have. Thanks for watching and we hope you enjoyed our app!
